 == ... I KNOW ... == 

   == **** AS A DEVELOPER **** ... Its not that much well organized and have a clean structure ... ==

 == *********** == 

== *** BUT WHY? *** ==

    == -Because - ==

 ==  **** While coding this project i was not aware ***  ==

=== ... THAT I WILL UPLOAD THIS PROJECT ON GITHUB ...  ===

===  ... so you maynot get a good sense of directory structure naming, OR the architecture/design. ===

==...but ...==

== **** since now i have uploaded this for some reasons so i would like you lookup to the files ignoring the structure of the repository **** ==

                   (=== HOPE SO YOU'LL UNDERSTAND ==)

                      (=== MANY THANKS ==)
